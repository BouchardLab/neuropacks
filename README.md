# neuropacks

A set of classes to parse various public and private neuroscience datasets.

## Public datasets

* [allen](https://observatory.brain-map.org/visualcoding) - The Allen Brain Observatory data sets contain calcium imaging data from visual cortices across many mice with a standardized set of stimuli.
* [dream](https://crcns.org/data-sets/movements/dream/overview) - The DREAM repository is a collection of reaching datasets available on CRCNS. Most of the DREAM datasets share the same file organization, but some may not.
* [hc6](https://crcns.org/data-sets/hc/hc-6) - Recordings from hippocampal CA1 and CA3 (or MEC and CA1) from the Frank lab hosted on CRCNS.
* [nhp](https://zenodo.org/record/583331) - Recordings from M1 and S1 from the Sabes lab. There are many datasets from different animals. indy_20160627_01.mat is a good place to start.
* [pv11](https://crcns.org/data-sets/vc/pvc-11/about) - Spontaneous and evoked V1 activity from macaque from the Kohn lab stored on CRCNS.
* [ret1](https://crcns.org/data-sets/retina/ret-1/about-ret-1) - Single-unit neural responses recorded from isolated retina from lab mice from the Meister lab stored on CRCNS.

## Private datasets

* peanut - /clusterfs/NSDS_data/external/franklab/peanut_day14/ - Recordings from HPc and PFc from the Frank lab during the execution of a maze task
